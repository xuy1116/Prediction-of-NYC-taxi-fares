Used multiple regression to predict taxi fares, data that would be used as part of a suite of models to optimize revenue for the New York Taxi and Limousine Commission and its drivers

# Background on the Automatidata
Automatidata works with its clients to transform their unused and stored data into useful solutions, such as performance dashboards, customer-facing tools, strategic business insights, and more. They specialize in identifying a client’s business needs and utilizing their data to meet those business needs. 

Automatidata is consulting for the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). New York City TLC is an agency responsible for licensing and regulating New York City's taxi cabs and for-hire vehicles. The agency has partnered with Automatidata to develop a regression model that helps estimate taxi fares before the ride, based on data that TLC has gathered. 

The TLC data comes from over 200,000 taxi and limousine licensees, making approximately one million combined trips per day. 

# Business Understanding 
According to salary.com the average salary for a New York Taxi Driver is around $45,000. This salary is significantly low compared to a median rent value of $6,500 per month. It is important to understand what factors encourage riders to leave tips in order to help drivers obtain a livable wage. 

# Data Understanding
The NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission data came from NYC.gov
The data consisted of approximately 408k unique trips and 18 features. The features included information on trip duration and destination, vendor used, toll information, and payment type. The bar chart below shows the breakdown of how many generous tippers (>20%) versus non-generous tippers that exist in the data set. 

In connection to this, a feature was engineered to represent if a ride was taken during rush hour or not. Multiple redundant columns were dropped and reformatted into the proper data type.  

# Modeling and Evaluation 
A random forest model comprising 100 decision trees was used to determine feature importance in who would tip generously or not. The below plot shows that trip duration, distance, and the cost of a fare were the Top 3 most important factors in determining a generous tipper from a non-generous one. The overall model performed with 86% accuracy and 72% precision. 

# Conclusion
This model can benefit Taxi Drivers in knowing if they will be tipped generously or not; however, running a parametric model to determine how much each variable will influence the actual price of the tip. In the future, adding more information on a rider’s past tipping behavior may also be beneficial in helping the stakeholder address their business problem.
